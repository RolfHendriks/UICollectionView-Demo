/**
 Defines a simple API for a UICollectionView with a 2D grid layout.
 
 Unlike UICollectionView, horizontal alignment defaults to constant horizontal spacing with flexible
 left + right margins. UICollectionView uses constant left + right margins with flexible inter item margins instead, which looks poor with narrow horizontal margins.
 
 Also defines an API for flexible sized grid cells that take up 
    all space not used by margins and inter item spacing.
